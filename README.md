## Getting Started

To begin using this Python implementation in your project, simply clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dielect/PyStatusPage.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Examples

Here's a quick example of how to use the API to retrieve the status of a page:

```python
from statuspagePyAPI.statuspage_api import StatusPageAPI


api = StatusPageAPI(api_key='YOUR_API_KEY')
res = api.components.get_components(page_id='YOUR_PAGE_ID')
print(res)
```

## Roadmap

- [ ] Add asynchronous support for concurrent API calls.
- [ ] Implement caching mechanisms for improved performance.
- [ ] Expand the suite of integration tests for better coverage.
